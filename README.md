This is a little program that walks the paths provided on the command line
to find pdf files, and then opens a random pdf to a random page. It only
works on MacOS but wouldn't be hard to port elsewhere.

Why? I have a lot of pdf files that I intend to read, but it's hard to decide
what to open. This lets serendipity take over.

## Installing

```
$ go install github.com/pteichman/randpage@latest
